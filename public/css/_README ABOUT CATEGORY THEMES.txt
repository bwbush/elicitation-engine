The category images are generated from:
Google Drive\NearZero\Image Assets and Templates\Discussion Header Template and Icons.ai
Which ALSO contains instructions on how to generate them.





IF YOU WANT A CATEGORY TO INCLUDE REPORT SUPPORT, THIS IS A SEPARATE FUNCTION, AND MORE DIFFICULT:
Find the category color:
A1) Find your category color in "Discussion Header Template and Icons.ai", and write it down

Export the category report image assets:
B1) Open "Google Drive\NearZero\Image Assets and Templates\Report Template.ai"
B2) Duplicate one of the existing layers (e.g. transportation or fossil)
B3) Change the text to the correct category name (e.g. change transportation to "my new category")
B4) Change the swatch color: called "Current Category Color". Double click to edit it, and use the color numbers found in "Discussion Header Template and Icons.ai". Redifining the swatch will recolour all parts of the image you need!
B5) Copy and paste the icon from "Discussion Header Template and Icons.ai"
B6) Change the icon stroke to white
B7) Use File->Save For Web
B8) Copy the PNGs into Content/home/images/your-category-name

Create a CSS section for the images/color:
C1) Edit Content/home/css/report.css, duplicate the wind CSS section, and find-replace wind with your category name. Change the color in two places to your category color.
